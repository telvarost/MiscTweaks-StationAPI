# MiscTweaks StationAPI Edition for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that tweaks random things that did not fit in my other mods such as allowing stairs recipe output to be changed.

**If you're looking for modern Minecraft recipes:** https://github.com/telvarost/MostlyModernRecipes-StationAPI

# Miscellaneous Tweaks

You will need ModMenu and GlassConfigAPI to change stairs recipe output and tweak other parts of the mod. See installation instructions below.

**There's a very high chance this mod will not work in multiplayer, as of right now it is purely for singleplayer**

## List of changes

All changes are default false/vanilla behavior unless otherwise specified.
