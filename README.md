# MiscTweaks StationAPI Edition for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that tweaks random things that did not fit in my other mods such as allowing stairs recipe output to be changed.

**If you're looking for modern Minecraft recipes:** https://github.com/telvarost/MostlyModernRecipes-StationAPI

# Miscellaneous Tweaks

You will need ModMenu and GlassConfigAPI to change stairs recipe output and tweak other parts of the mod. See installation instructions below.
* Mod now works on Multiplayer with GlassConfigAPI version 2.0+ used to sync configs!

## List of changes

All changes are default false/vanilla behavior unless otherwise specified

### Armor Changes
* Equalize base armor durability
  * Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Boots will all have the same durability
* Modern armor defense points
  * Lower tiers have less defense and defense does not decrease with durability loss

### Block Entity Changes
* Allow chests to be opened even when a solid block is above them
* Allow editing signs with a feather (feather is consumed on use)
* Allow coloring signs with dye (dye is consumed on use)
  * Coloring signs is incompatible with MojangFix
  * Use [MojangFixStationAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/misctweaks-stationapi)'s config to disable MojangFix signs to use colored signs
    * Config is available through [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu-beta) and [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api)

### Explosion/Fire Changes
* Allow ghast fireballs to insta-kill ghasts
* Allow defusing TNT with shears (use left-click to defuse)
* Disable all explosions
  * Disable TNT explosions breaking blocks
  * Disable creeper explosions breaking blocks
  * Disable ghast explosions breaking blocks
* Disable ghast explosions causing fire

### Flora Changes
* Allow collecting ferns with shears
  * [BHCreative](https://modrinth.com/mod/bh-creative) is required for this as b1.7.3 does not have an item for it
  * Item is non-vanilla and will disappear if BHCreative is removed
* Allow collecting tall grass with shears
* Allow collecting dead bushes with shears
* Allow random chance for dead bushes to drop a stick
  * The percent chance is the same as getting seeds from tall grass (12.5%)
* Allow random chance for apples to drop from oak leaves
  * The percent chance can be chosen via the config
* Disable leaf decay for player placed leaves
* Enable log rotation for oak, spruce, and birch logs
  * This uses the extra metadata bits for rotation
    * So when disabled the rotated logs will appear as oak, but drop a different block type similar to how crash slabs work

### Mob Changes
* Add ability to enable different zombie pigman drops
  * Select between: cooked porkchops, raw porkchops, brown mushrooms, gold sword, bone meal, brick, or nothing
* Add ability to enable different zombie drops
  * Select between: feathers, red mushrooms, cyan dye, green dye, clay, paper, or nothing
* Disable player/mobs trampling farmland
* Disable player trampling farmland if player is not wearing boots
* Disable player trampling farmland if player is wearing leather boots

### Slab Changes
* Add recipe for crafting vanilla double stone slabs
  * Recipe is single stone slab above single stone slab in crafting grid
  * There is also a crafting recipe to turn the double stone slab back into two single stone slabs
  * Double stone slabs behave like single stone slabs when placed on top of single stone slabs

## Dispenser changes moved to DispenserTweaks
