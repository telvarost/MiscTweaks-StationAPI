# MiscTweaks StationAPI Edition for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that tweaks random things that did not fit in my other mods such as allowing stairs recipe output to be changed.

**If you're looking for modern Minecraft recipes:** https://github.com/telvarost/MostlyModernRecipes-StationAPI

# Miscellaneous Tweaks

You will need ModMenu and GlassConfigAPI to change stairs recipe output and tweak other parts of the mod. See installation instructions below.

**There's a very high chance this mod will not work in multiplayer, as of right now it is purely for singleplayer**

## List of changes

* Allow editing signs with a feather (feather is consumed on use), default true.
* Allow coloring signs with dye (dye is consumed on use), default true.
* Disable creeper explosions breaking blocks, default false.
* Disable ghast explosions causing fire, default false.
* Disable ghast explosions breaking blocks, default false.
* Shapeless Jack o‚Äô Lanterns, default true.
* Stairs recipes craft 1-16 stairs, default 4.
  * Note: There currently seems to be a bug with GlassConfigAPI where Integer configs need to be saved twice to take effect
* Modern Dispenser Fluid Placement, default false.
  * Allows dispensers to place and pick up water/lava with buckets
* Modded Dispenser Fluid Placement, default false.
  * Dispensers cannot pick up water/lava source blocks when dry
    * This is to fulfill the iron requirement of picking up water/lava and makes sense in terms of some real life fluid pumps that don't run when dry
  * Craft water/lava source blocks from water/lava buckets (bucket will be consumed) and use them in dispensers
    * Stack size of water/lava source blocks changed to 1
    * Water source blocks will evaporate if placed in the nether
    * Config option added for using lava source blocks as fuel in furnaces, default true
  * Dispensers will fizzle and fail to dispense water/lava blocks if there is a solid block in front of the dispenser
